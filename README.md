# MSc-Group-Project
A group project conducted throughout both semesters of my MSc, investigating whether reoccurring lockdowns had an impact on prescription rates across England. Different R scripts were used for the project workflow. 

A redacted version of the final project poster is present. The R scripts for each part of the workflow are present as well.
